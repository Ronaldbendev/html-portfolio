<h1>The Best Movies According to Ronald Ben</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Secondhand Lion</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite movies. It feels authentic, with a compelling story and an unexpected twist at the end.</p>
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>One of my favorite series because of its numerous plot twists and outstanding casting. Each episode offers valuable lessons to learn.</p>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>I enjoyed predicting most of the Titans and had a theory that all Titans originated from humans, which added to my excitement while watching.
