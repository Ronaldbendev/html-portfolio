<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This is my first project uploaded to my GitHub account!</p>

<p>
  Hi there! My name is Ronald Ben Bargayo, and I am a beginner in the exciting world of web development. While I am just starting out, I am passionate about learning how to build websites and applications that are both functional and visually appealing.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently exploring the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m excited to dive deeper into the tools and technologies that power the web. Every line of code I write feels like a step closer to creating something meaningful and impactful.
</p>

<p>
  What inspires me the most about web development is its ability to bring ideas to life and connect people across the globe. As I learn and grow, I aim to develop the skills needed to create user-friendly websites and contribute to real-world projects.
</p>

<p>
  For now, I’m focusing on building a strong foundation in coding and learning from resources, tutorials, and the developer community. I believe that with dedication and persistence, I can turn my passion into a rewarding career.
